### timing

- comparing to these numbers isn't necessarily useful
- normalize your timing to day 1 part 1 and compare
- alternate implementations are listed in parens
- these timings are very non-scientific (sample size 1)

```console
$ find -maxdepth 1 -type d -name 'day*' -not -name day00 | sort | xargs --replace bash -xc 'python {}/part1.py {}/input.txt; python {}/part2.py {}/input.txt'
+ python day01/part1.py day01/input.txt
71300
> 431 Î¼s
